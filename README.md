# Using the VibeCodingTemplate

This template provides a structured foundation for your software projects with a focus on comprehensive documentation and smooth workflow. Here's how to use it effectively:

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download this template** to use as the base for your new project
2. **Review the documentation structure** to understand the components:
   - Business Requirements Document (BRD)
   - Product Requirements Document (PRD)
   - Requirements Traceability Matrix
   - Tech Stack Document

## Making This Template Viable

### Essential Steps:

1. **Complete the documentation files** with your specific project details:

   - Fill in the BRD with your business objectives, target audience, and success metrics
   - Develop the PRD with detailed features, user stories, and acceptance criteria
   - Create relationships in the Requirements Traceability Matrix
   - Define your specific technology choices in the Tech Stack Document
2. **Setup your development environment**:

   - Update the `.gitignore` file based on your selected tech stack
   - Initialize version control if starting a new repository
   - Configure any necessary build tools or dependencies
3. **Integrate with your workflow**:

   - Connect documentation to your project management tools
   - Establish review processes for documentation updates
   - Set up regular documentation maintenance schedule

### Best Practices:

- **Keep documentation living** - Update regularly as requirements evolve
- **Use AI assistance** - As mentioned in the ToDo, leverage AI tools to help maintain and improve documentation
- **Customize for your team** - Adapt the structure to match your team's workflow and communication style
- **Standardize formats** - Consider using Pandoc (mentioned in the Tools section) to maintain consistent formatting

# Project Documentation Overview

This project contains several key documents that provide a comprehensive foundation for your vibe coding platform. Each document serves a specific purpose and is intended for use by different stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

## 1. Business Requirements Document ([BRD](./Documents/Business_Requirements_Document.md))

- **Purpose:** Defines the high-level business needs, objectives, and expectations for your vibe coding project.
- **Use:** Serves as the foundation for all subsequent project documentation and development activities. It is used by business stakeholders, product managers, and project sponsors to ensure alignment on goals, market opportunities, and success criteria.

## 2. Product Requirements Document ([PRD](./Documents/Product_Requirements_Document.md))

- **Purpose:** Translates business requirements into specific product features, functionality, and user stories.
- **Use:** Guides the development team in building the product. It is referenced by product managers, designers, and engineers to understand what needs to be built, for whom, and why. It also defines acceptance criteria for features.

## 3. Requirements Traceability [Matrix](./Documents/Requirements_Traceability_Matrix.md)

- **Purpose:** Maps each business requirement (from the BRD) to corresponding product requirements (from the PRD).
- **Use:** Ensures that all business needs are addressed in the product and that every product feature is justified by a business requirement. It is used for impact analysis, change management, and validation throughout the project lifecycle.

## 4. [Tech Stack](./Documents/Tech_Stack_Document.md) Document

- **Purpose:** Outlines the technologies, frameworks, tools, and infrastructure components used to build your vibe coding platform.
- **Use:** Provides technical guidance for the engineering team and transparency for stakeholders. It helps ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability of the platform, and is updated as technology choices evolve.

---

**How to Use These Documents:**

- Start with the BRD to understand the business context and objectives.
- Refer to the PRD for detailed product features and requirements.
- Use the Requirements Traceability Matrix to verify alignment between business needs and product features.
- Consult the Tech Stack Document for technical implementation details and technology decisions.

These documents should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project progresses to ensure continued alignment and clarity for all stakeholders.

## 6. ToDo

1. Update all documents to meet your needs
2. Modify the Tech Stack Documentstion to meet your needs.
3. Replace the .gitignore with one that will work best based on the tech stack or have ai generate one for you.
4. Employ AI as need, giving access to the documentation.
5. Have fun!
