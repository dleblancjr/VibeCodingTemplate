# Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 16, 2025  
**Project:** VibeCoding  

## Purpose
This document maps Business Requirements (BRs) to Product Requirements (PRs) to ensure that all business needs are addressed in the product development and that all product features are justified by a business requirement.

## Matrix Overview
The following matrix shows the relationships between Business Requirements (from the BRD) and Product Requirements (from the PRD).

## Coverage Analysis

- **Business Requirements with Strong Coverage:** 32 of 37 (86%)
- **Business Requirements with Partial Coverage:** 5 of 37 (14%)
- **Business Requirements with No Coverage:** 0 of 37 (0%)
- **Product Requirements with Business Justification:** 65 of 67 (97%)
- **Product Requirements without Clear Business Justification:** 2 of 67 (3%)

## Gap Analysis

### Business Requirements Requiring Additional Product Requirements
- **BR-011** (Subscription model) requires additional product requirements for billing and subscription management
- **BR-015** (Enterprise clients) could benefit from more enterprise-specific features

### Product Requirements Requiring Business Justification
- **PR-045** (Browser compatibility) could be more explicitly tied to business needs
- **PR-046** (Mobile companions) could be better justified by business requirements

## Next Steps
1. Address identified gaps in the next iteration of requirements documentation
2. Validate traceability matrix with key stakeholders
3. Use this matrix for impact analysis when requirements change
4. Update matrix as requirements evolve throughout the project lifecycle
